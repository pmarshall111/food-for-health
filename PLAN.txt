Add in redux form to project.

Connect up to state
start creating add info form

have a button at the bottom to get started - which could either open a popup to ask if the user wants to save
their details, or we could have a button before the get started button that will enable the user to do it there

right now I'm in favour of the popup idea as that will probably get more users to sign up and be repeat users.

_____

get a boilerplate navbar component and edit it to our liking.

Add a scroll down component that once clicked has the arrow turn upside down and makes the page scroll
either up or down depending on which way the arrow is pointing.

find a few pictures to be the background of these pages

leave the cool howitworks thing to the end f the project.
Presentational stuff that is statement should be left till the end.

____ this will be the end of the intro page.



Tomorrow todo:

- add in info section to activity Estimate
- make the form look orderly
