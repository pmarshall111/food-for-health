  render() {
    return <div />;
  }
}

export default HowItWorks;

//component will have a nice modern looking thing that shows the user the steps needed to get their recipes.
//keep it simple so not much text. hopefully say everything within our graphic.

//what do we want to say - how many recipes we have
//how many health benefits or vitamins we cover.

//1. add your details or sign in with an account you've already added the details to.
//2. tell us what type of dish you'd like to eat. It can be an ingredient or a meal in general.
//3. select the body function you'd like to improve, or the vitamin you'd like more of
//4. we will give you a recipe that will fit your requirements.
//5. cook it and enjoy your goodness!

//with this component we could either have a thing that goes round, or we could have something that
//shows all possible routes - i.e. log in with your already created account OR give us your details,
//then you don't need to create and account OR you can so you can use it next time.

//2 possibilities - one which goes to the default route and the other goes and splits again.
